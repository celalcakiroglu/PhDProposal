A proper DIC analysis requires images with a non-uniform high-contrast speckle pattern.
The principal result of a (C)WP test for a strainbased assessment is the relation between crack driving force and the remotely applied longitudinal strain (remote strain), whose proper measurement is key to obtaining a valid test result
Development of an Intelligent Alarm Mechanism for the Prevention of Pipeline Failure 
In this presentation I am going to explain why Enbridge has to invest 50K for an intelligent alarm system
Due To Tensile Strain 
Either there is risk of pipe rupture or not
We need an intelligent alarm mechanism which monitors the strain distribution of the pipe wall and is capable of deciding if there is risk or not.
As humans can distinguish between a sports car and a car which is not a sports car, similarly machines can learn to classify by examples.
Once we have the classification algorithm, we can implement it in microcontrollers embedded on the pipe wall.
These microcontrollers will be connected to strain gauges.
